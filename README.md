# Technical Resume Guidelines

## Overview: 
Recruiters are looking for your technical ability and experience building things. You should focus your resume on **WHAT** you developed, **HOW** you developed it, and what frameworks you used to build it. A recruiter cares that you implemented X using Y to parse, build an API, etc. You want to focus on the *technical* things you have accomplished.

## General Resume Advice and Common Mistakes:
#### Resume Sections:
* If you have some solid work experience already, I suggest ordering your sections in the order: 
    * education
    * experience
    * projects
    * skills
    * activities
    * awards
* If most of your technical experience is through projects:
    * education
    * projects
    * experience
    * skills
    * activities
    * awards
#### Describing Work Experience and Projects
* A good starting structure is to put 1 bullet as a concise description of the overall project
* In the next bullets **describe** what **features** you developed and **how**
    * Example: instead of saying you "built a frontend website", you could say "developed responsive login page and implemented calendar visualization with React.js"
    * Example: Instead of just saying you "built new location-based iOS app for users to meet others", split this up into discrete chunks. 
        1. "developed realtime location iOS app with Swift and Firebase"
        2. "implemented location filtering algorithm to..."
        3. "parsed X API data and constructed Y database schema"
        4. "designed and built interactive user profile cards"
* Start off each bullet with a power verb (ie developed, implemented, designed, analyzed) 
* Include what popular frameworks you used to build your project (ie. node.js, react.js, etc.)
* tldr; be more descriptive about what features you developed and how, use power verbs!

#### Education
* **IMPORTANT: Put expected graduation MM/YYYY**
* Don't put when you started college
* Leave out highschool education info
    * An exception to this is if you are a first year college student and don't have too much to put on your resume yet
* For coursework, don't put course numbers because they mean nothing to someone not attending your college. Put a course name that means something to anyone external.

#### Skills:
* ***Exclude*** from skills
    * IDEs (XCode, Visual Studio, Sublime Text, etc.)
    * software applications (Adobe Photoshop, etc.)
    * Operating Systems (Windows, OSX, Linux)
    * foreign languages

#### Contact Info
* Don't put your home address (no one mails you anymore)
* Don't put your LinkedIn (unnecessary)

#### Miscellaneous
* Omit the objective. Those are outdated.
