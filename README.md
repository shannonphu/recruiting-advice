# Resume Guidelines

### Overview: 
Recruiters are looking for your technical ability and experience building things. You should focus your resume on WHAT you developed, HOW you developed it, and what frameworks you used to build it. A recruiter cares that you implemented X using Y to parse, build an API, etc.

### General Resume Advice:
1. I would suggest ordering your sections in the order: education, experience, projects, skill, activities, awards.
2. For skills, I would exclude foreign languages, IDEs and software applications as skills, like Visual Studio, Xcode, Adobe Photoshop, etc.
3. For work experience and projects, a good structure is to put 1 bullet as a concise description of the overall project. Then in the next bullets describe what features you developed and how. For example instead of "designed user flows", you could say "developed views and implemented client-side logic to ________". Start off each bullet with a power verb (ie developed, implemented, designed, analyzed). You should try to be more descriptive about what features you developed and how.
4. For education, you don't have to put when you started UCLA. Just put expected graduation MM/YYYY. Leave out highschool education info.
5. You don't have to put your home address or LinkedIn really.
6. You can omit the objective. Those are outdated.
7. For coursework, don't put course numbers because they mean nothing to someone not attending UCLA. Put a course name that means something to anyone external.
