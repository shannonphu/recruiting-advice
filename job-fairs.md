# How to talk to a recruiter at a job fair

You try to stand out to recruiters by talking about what relevant work/project experience you've already done. How I go about this is the following steps:
1. Firm handshake + introduction (name + major + year)
2. State what role you're looking for (ie software engineering internship)
3. Ask what opportunities their company has for that role and what the program is like
4. Then talk about your past experiences (past internship or projects you've done) and how you think you'd learn a lot through an internship at their company
5. Ask meaningful questions about their internship program/company. Some good questions I always ask are: 
	* How does team/project placement work? 
	* How will the program provide mentorship for you? 
	* What have some past interns worked on?
